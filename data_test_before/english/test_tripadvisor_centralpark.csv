especially central park it was simply amazing.... you are at one with nature even in the busiest city in the world when you are at central park ... a must visit for all to unwind and relax ....
"Heaps to see and do
The park is huge so its not something you can do it all easily. We had been before in winter and just walked from one side to another. This time in warmer weather it was so nice to wander around and see the sights. Read up on the history as you go well worth it. Very pleasant , great place for photos."
Service was great. The hotel had arranged for a pick up from station at midnight. They even arranged for rail ticket in such a rush hour. Location and service is excellent. Food is also delicious
"wonderful place to spend an afternoon. nice and relaxing. great for kids. Good for walking or jogging, or just people watching."
Most Beautiful Park I’ve Seen and It’s HUGEEE!
"Saturday, was a beautiful day. my friend and I spent the day in Central Park. It was a perfect day. I loved it."
"I love every ends of Central Park. Great for bird watching, to have picnic, the zoo, the small ponds with the ducks and turtles, the endless views of the city, and the list goes on."
"Central Park is truly a unique place. You wouldn't even believe you were in the nation's largest city. They have all kinds of trails to take you away from the hustle and bustle, but also large open spaces where people just relax and hang out. So many people rent bikes, but you can see the most exploring by foot if you have the time. The street performers also add to the atmosphere."
Absolute love it
Central Park provides NY the most needed nature. Nowadays it’s part of the city’s identity with plenty of locals using it for their workouts. It’s lakes and gardens located in the middle of the skyscrapers are beautiful. Incredible!
Avoid Central Park like the plague until the city has had some time to recover from Bill Deblasio. Right now you’re taking your life into your own hands.
Intimidated and Harrassed.
"As far as I can see, strictly a tourist trap. I have never seen a green space so full of invasive weeds ever. If you want to promote this space, then actually maintain it. My farm is bigger than this place and better maintained. So disappointed. Will never return."
Not the experience I was hoping for
Big mistake!
"Dirty, smelly experience"
"Filthy dirty, scary, rip off, what a joke"
"The restrooms are very bad. Hard to find and very dirty plastic cabins! Park on Sunday is horrible, too many people!"
Such a disappointment!
What a disgusting park - Definitely does not live up to its rating

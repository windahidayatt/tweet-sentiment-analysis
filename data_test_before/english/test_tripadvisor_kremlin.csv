Totally horrible set up at the Moscow Kremlin ticket offices! There's a separate ticket office for each museum with a long line of visitors.
There was an event that day and only one access point was open to even get to the area where tickets are purchased. Disappointed that I still don’t know what I was looking at.
"Just walls, nothing particular, security officers everywhere Very heavy atmosphere full with soldiers Like permanent attack Dislike"
"It's uncomfortable place. All clean and beautiful buildings, but sometimes nobody around and you feel unsafe, like it was in North Korea."
We bought tickets after we asked twice if we could visit the palace. When we were actually in were told it is closed to the public. We would have preferred doing something else especially because we are travelling with a very young baby who is not used to being outside in this cold weather. We wasted half a day there
They didn't warn me from my hotel that the place is close on every thursday so i took a long way to go there but i couldn't see iton my first day there. On my second i went there and it was open but it was literally disspointing. 
"Closed without warning despite having been told by the ticket office the day before to there was no need book and to just turn up. Feel completely cheated as that was our last day so, having read up on the history etc, we never got to see it."
I now have a bad taste in my mouth regarding Moscow as that is my last experience. Awful.
I've visited many places in Moscow and this is the only one I can't recommend.
Crazy security and police does not give to look what you want. You can see only some small part of historical heritage of all inhabitants of Russia. It is created full of feeling of a totaltarizm of Russia
Moscow kremlin is a very special place in Moscow. It can not be compared with nothing else. To see and visit cathedrals which played an important role in a live of Russian tsars.
"Grand and beautiful city. Tourist friendly. Friendly people. world cusine.well connected public transport. cheap and well connevted telecom services.Excellent shopping ecperience. Loads of tourist attractions. Favourite places.. Arbat,Kremlin,sparrow hill,Red square. A must visit destination."
"Kremlin is one of these iconic must see things that you can’t miss when you are in Moscow. You have to see the Red Square and you have to see Kremlin! Politically, historically and artistically speaking! "
"Absolutely stunning. Surely one of the most powerful places on the planet. You can visit the cathedral square, diamond fund and armoury by purchasing tickets at the ticketing office on the day in Alexander Gardens (some tickets are time specific) "
The Kremlin compound is very impressive with an impressive collection of buildings and other monumental artifacts. We entered through the Troitskaya Tower and first reached the large congress hall where once the central committee of the communist party had its meetings and today it is a theater.
Very historical center city in the heart of what was once the Soviet Union. Recommended to take local AeroExpress to Belasuskanya then take the green line to the theater district. Highly recommend
a worth while visit to be fair ..the churches all start to look a bit samey on the inside but the outside is crazy beautiful...dont leave out visiting the armoury its a one off never to be forgotten
Not dissapointed
It is not easy to get the tickets. The best way is to do it online upfront. But the experience is great. You need to visit it when you are in Moscow.
Stunningly beautiful.

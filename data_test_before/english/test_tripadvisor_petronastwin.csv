It looks sexy. The architecture is evergreen. More and more towers are built in Kuala Lumpur but this is still the epicenter.

It's beautiful and shiny during the day and nicknamed the corn (jagung) at night.
"I'll give 5 stars for this amazing tourist spot. It never disappoints me whenever I will visit here. So fascinating, will come back again."
Perfect view at night. We spent there for 2 hours with my girlfriend enjoying the sunset. It was our first location in Kuala Lumpur
Visit this when you travel in malaysia nice view for all people... even at night it’s more beautiful here…
"very nice tower in malaysia!!! so i was very excited. and many people take a picture on ponds, very nice haha"
Breathtaking. Very beautiful. I also had the chance to walk on the bridge connecting the twin towers. Beautiful view from there
Enjoying in EMCO trip.That's so nice view and panorama over there with good SOP. Iam so loved it.I think better go here with family. Its happening.
Amazing. I took over 100 pictures of the buildings. The towers are so impressive. To bad you can only stay for a short time. We did not plan on going to Kuala Lumpur but so glad that we did. What a amazing city. The towers were the highlight of our roundtrip trouhg asia.
What a terribly disappointing experience:( Rushed the whole way through and only given NINE minutes on the top level.
Total disappointment.
"Really nothing special about this twin tower.
If this is a reason to visit KL, better safe the money and go Bangkok or Singapore."
Nothing interesting in viewing the KL from above... 
Not Impressed. Disappointed.
Worst visit to a high rise attractions
"Very disappointed, dirty windows and spotlights do not allow for good pictures"
The worst visit in whole Malaysia
Expensive Overpriced Western branding and marketing at its worst
Poorly managed - not worth it

Massive beach with plenty of space for everyone ! quite relaxing and very sunny most of the times ! the sea thought is very rough and you cant swimm because the waves are big and there is many people surfing! if you are a surfer is amazing !
"Amazing God , amazing beach, so many peoples like to use their time for waiting a sunset every day.
If you stay at Kuta. Go there guys :)"
"Great place to surf for the beginners.
There are tons of surfing schools to choose from.
Hopefully you can find the right person."
One of the famous beach. We had a beach cleaning so far. And it quite fun actually. Especially when we did a positive thing for the mother earth
Lovely beach.
Very beautiful beach and clean and very blue when you go there to relax carry money with you if you wish to rent a chair or shade there are touts here like everywhere else in Bali it's worth it in the tropical heat if it's a lil' but toot much for you.
Very nice beach with lovely sand with a great market attached too so you can grab a few Bali bargains as you walk to the beach
took an afternoon just to unwind from shopping. Great watching the ocean. Lots of surfing. Beautiful trees provide ample shade. String of small restaurants with good food. Nice ambience
Very lovely beach with nice surf and local vendors selling souvenirs and offering massages. Cold beers are cheap and the sunset is fantastic
Loved the sunset here! The surf is good also. Cold beers from the local vendors are the perfect compliment
Very dirty and annoying locals
"Dirty and noise, people with dirty chear want to sell you to sit down on them. You
can't sit on the beach beucause it is soo dirty, everything is so dirty"
Not a great beach at all. A very dirty shoreline and a heap of dude's trying to rip you off. Better of going to Seminyak. People pestering you to buy things everywhere you go.
"Absolutely horrible beach.. trash is everywhere, ocean is dirty.. everywhere are plastic bottles and broken glass ! Horrible really.. So sad view :("
We walked onto the beach. Walked for about 5 minutes and then turned around. The beach is disgusting.
"It's full of garbage on the whole line of shores, even dead blowfish with a lot of flies left there and noone seemed to care to clean it up. I took pictures of some only."
The beach was dirty with lots of dogs and faeces. As soon as you step onto the beach you are harassed to rent some under par chairs by many locals. Left the beach and went to the mall area behind. I can see why the pools in Kuta are more popular.
"Overcrowded, hard to get to, not worth the time unless you like to surf. The beach is in great shape and free of trash."
"Great place for bogans and schoolies wanting to get pissed and enjoy their cheap package deal annual vacation.
Crowded, dirty, noisy, gross."
Kuta was the only place I felt uncomfortable when I was in Bali.

"Went over Chinese New Year and absolutely loved seeing the temples of Bangkok. Despite of the holiday, it wasn't crowded at all. This is a must see!"
THIS VERY BIG CASTLE is a right place for a first timer learning history and Culture in Thailand. Gorgeous
"The Grand Palace is definitely a place to visit. Both because of its history and also its beauty. And as the number of tourist at present unfortunately are few, this is a perfect time to visit and avoid the ques and crowds."
"It is a very large palace and has beautiful decorations that imply a Thai style. Impressed by walking and paying respect to the Jade Buddha amulet The place is spacious and the surrounding area has temples and palaces in the same area, beautiful and very impressive."
"The Grand Palace is a must see in Bangkok. There are staff checking that you adhere to the dress code when you enter the complex, which is expected due to it being a religious site. The temples are amazing - such amazing detail! A must visit in Bangkok!"
This is a must see on the tourist cicuit. You have to follow a strict dress code to enter. Though it is a palace the king and queen do not live here. But you get to see some very grand buildings.
I came here with friends you explore the city and I think I left my heart in this spot. It's so beautiful. I definitely recommend to see it.
GreatVery good place with amazing details. A lot of people are here all the time. It's a must if you are visiting the city for the first time.
This place is a must if you are visiting for the first time. There are a lot of people all the time there but it's important place.
"Amazing experience, very crowded, but still worthy, beautiful architecture, the temple of the emerald Budha is inside, and you can't miss the opportunity of visiting Grand Palace. Don't forget to wear trousers, and cover your shoulders. You can't miss that experience."
"Expensive, lacking in quality information and audio guide poor. Staff officious. Full of selfie takers making it a pain to walk around. Very little shade, so really hot on a sunny day. Definitely missable"
"Expensive and very strict dress code. Ripped off having to buy additional clothing. Must wear long sleeves and long pants/ skirts, no activewear."
"You need to wear long pants and shirts to cover your knees and elbows. It's overcrowded and expensive. There are plenty of temples and other Thai structures that are free to visit in and around Bangkok, Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai that are less crowded"

This was one of the worst tours we have ever been to. It was so crowded and you do not get to see but the outside if the buildings at the palace. 
"
Terrible experience for foreigners"
"Overpriced, overcrowded and overrated. While the architecture of the place is amazing, you can most definitely find other temples and structures in Bangkok just as impressive for a fraction of the ticket price which is 500 baht. Plus, you don't actually enter the palace since it's closed to the public, you just pass by it! What you see in the pictures is what you get and nothing more. Also, if you're not dressed modestly they make you buy cheap clothes for double the price from the gift shop. Crowds + bad value for money + heat + ripoff = bad experience!"
"Horribly crowded, loud and noisy. Tour groups spoiled visit. Total chaos and not well organized. I decided to leave. After 15 minutes."
A beautiful place destroyed by over tourism.
What a terrible experience.

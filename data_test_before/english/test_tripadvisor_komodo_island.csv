Disappointed and feeling ripped off
Erna Baggage Handler at Labuan Bajo Airport = VERY DISGUSTING
Disappointing and cruel visit
So much trash in a national park/UNESCO site - disgraceful! UNESCO should revoke its status.
"Like I said, I was hugely disappointed. I also read that the komodos mate in June-July. Based on the trip advisor reviews, it seems that the rangers tell everyone its mating season, no matter which month u go."
"We were very disappointed. Everybody gets into groups, walks around the island with a tour guide. Don't stop and look at anything, it becomes apparent that you’re not going to see anything yet. "
Very big disappointment - Extremely poor guided experience
"komodo are fed by staff, UNCLE LOUIE was very rude and intimidating"
Too strenuous in the heat and humidity. No shelter just aimless walking. Not recommended. Annoying traders at end of the trek.
Komodo Island is very dissapointing if you want to see Dtagons in the wild
"It was an amazing experience, and happy the dragons were out and about. It was unexpected and the park rangers also said they weren't sure if they would be out at the time of day we arrived, but they were out and about and around us. It was great to see them in the natural habitat and happy that they're being taken care of. It was a great experience and happy I made it!"
"Best place ever, a must go for all. Lots to see, the dragons are amazing, staff are friendly and very up to speed"
Amazing experience
Tour was excellent. We enjoyed every bit of it.
Always wanted to visit this place since I was little and finally made it. It is hot but it is beautiful.
"Jaw-dropping, pant wetting, raised heartbeat, sweaty palms, heart-pounding, makes bill and teds excellent adventure seem like having a leg amputated, sadly one too many Chinese who assume Komodo dragons can be reasoned with hence one guy losing his leg, haha serves you right but apart from this guy this was one of the greatest experiences in my life, a great fun-filled day out, so sell your shares and go and enjoy life..."
Very unique......walking is good for all ages..... very well organized and safe.........must take the speed boat
The island is beautiful and it feels like entering Jurassic Park. We were all excited! 
Went to this island and seen lots of komodo dragon and we stopped over in Padar and served beautiful view.
A very well managed tour

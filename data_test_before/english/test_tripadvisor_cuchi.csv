"Anti-american. Medals for how many Americans were killed, Not how many enemies were killed. They say other countries involved but when people specifically target a certain countries citizens reminds me on Nazi Germany."
"I felt that a shooting range at a place where 55,000 died in pretty horrific circumstances was a wee bit insensitive and inappropriate"
Horrible way of capitalizing on the dead! DO NOT GO IF YOU RESPECT THE DEAD.
"Very disappointing, everyone having fun at a tragic site"
Worst experience ever - tourist trap alert!
We were told this was a must see thing to do and were very disappointed. It was all a bit distasteful. Get down this hole and pose for a comedy photo! Shoot some AK47s! I would recommend going to the war remnants museum instead - we just didn’t like this place at all.
Irreverent and thoroughly disappointing
A very disappointing historical site
Lacks respect it deserves. Terrible guides!
Very disappointed. 2 hours or more driving each way so we could walk the entirety of the “tunnels”. Actually just one small portion of a single tunnel. They talk about tunnels being hundreds of km. So I dressed for a day underground. 5 minutes. That’s all. And that was because some guy blocked us so he could get my guide to take some photos. Plus going again... mmm. I thought it would be an adventure tour but it was less than an hour to eat ice cream and listen to a bit of history and 5 minutes for the actual tunnel. Could possibly be extended into two hours if you count the rifle range and have a huge tour group.
We went to cu chi tunnels with our guide. He told us many stories about this land and when we arrived and experienced the tunnels we knew that how Vietnamese could win US. They were strong to live in the tunnels for 21 years. they fought for peace of the country. We respected it. Must go when you come to HCM!
It was just amazing that the US and South Vietnam forces for many years couldn't remove the tunnels even though they knew about it. It was the pain in the neck.
This is an amazing place and I learnt so much about the impressive tunnel system. Only one short bit is available for tourists to physically experience and that has been made with greatly enlarged entrance/exit and strengthened roof etc.
"Visited as part of a tour. Interesting to learn of the history of the Vietnam war. It has been heavily modified for tourists, but well worth a visit."
great day in Cu chi tunnel
We enjoyed our visit and the insight into how the Viet Cong defended their country and how they lived during this time. The man traps designed to injure rather than kill were cruel but ingenious.
"An absolute must see, well worth the drive from Ho Chi Minh City. A great way to experience for yourself some of the realities of the Vietnam war, walking through the tunnels is surreal and not for the claustrophobic, but we and our children (10 & 13) found it enjoyable."
"Visited the Cu Chi tunnels on a tour of Vietnam. Very interesting, and well documented the underground life of the Vietcong during the war."
This was quite a daunting area to visit. Our tour guide was very knowledgeable. It's unbelievable the steps the local people had to take to protect their country and they are such a pleasant and friendly nation.
Was very interesting seeing and listening to some of the ingenious techniques used by the Viet Cong during the Vietnam war.

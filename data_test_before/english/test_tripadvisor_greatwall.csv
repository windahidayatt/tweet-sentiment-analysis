We had a really bad accident with the slider because the vehicle did not stop There are no safety measures
"Helicopter flying around and annoys the whole time, do not go there, disappointing!"
"It's like Disneyland but without the fun. The whole thing is reconstructed, costs a little fortune to use their cable car and shuttle bus. Better to watch a documentary on the National Geographic channel in the comfort of your own home. car and shuttle bus. Better to watch a documentary on the National Geographic channel in the comfort of your own home."
"so many people there , and the staff there is terrible"
"Awful, horrible, traumatic, evil - it's the only way to describe this place"
"I don't want to give any stars to this semi-tour!! Very unpleasant experience during our tour. I really wonder about all these good reviews! Unfortunately, this is one of the worst experience I've had with a tour provider and not recommend this tour based on my experience."
Terrible experience getting to the wall
"We we pressured to buy things. Further another jade Shop appear to be run by some local mafia, just complete waste of time."
Bad experience buying tickets
a very disappointing experience. Very touristy - you walk for miles through a shopping street before getting to the entrance of the Wall. You can walk up or take a lift. Plus too many people. If you can go and see the wall at a more remote location.
"I kept seeing pictures of the crowds at the Great Wall. Well, not when we were there. We had the place practically to ourselves for almost 2 hours. Get there early! Glorious!"
Awesome place to stay for a visit to the wall. Fantastic staff and the rooms have a stunning view of the mountains and the wall. Will definately stay again!
"Absolutely stunning place. as i had short time i used cable car. but hiking is highly recommended, buy your ticket online beforehand."
Was amazed by the splendid view and the spirit of chinese people; parents with little children and old people climbing the stairs; simply wonderful
"I’ve been fortunate to see this part of the wall three times and it never disappoints, especially with first time visitors. It’s an easy visit, and well worth a visit. If you go in the winter, it’s incredible. Cold, but pretty."
This was an amazing experience! It was a small hike to the cable car (I recommend not pigging out on dumplings right before) and then a short ride to the top of the wall. The views were amazing and the wall seems to go on forever. I highly recommend taking to toboggan back down to the bottom...just don’t expect any belts or safety equipment.
What an amazing trip this was. One of the world wonders. Truly remarkable. Be aware of the slippery roads.
"If you are wondering which of the great walls to go, i will highly recommend this one at Mutianyu! Lesser tourist, public transport available and coupled with the great views on offer."
"it is a life time experience must visit and easier than badaling a 2 hr journey from beijing, lift and cable car access to top available for elderly, astounding views and awe inspiring feelings and the drive is scenic"
"Nice views, easy to get to. Worth the visit. On a clear day you can see far and wide, all the different slopes and sections that scatter the countryside."

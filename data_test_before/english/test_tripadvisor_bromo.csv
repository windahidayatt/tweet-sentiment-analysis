Horrible place
A nightmare.
"Pay attention, we had really bad experience with the mafia out of the station of Probolinggo. "
"Sadly the Bromo Tour, organised from "" BromoJavaTravelAgent"" was extremely disappointing."
Worst experience in indonesia : handled by local mafia
Horrible place to go for
It was a terrible experience. 
"We didn't sleep, left at midnight, we changed into the jeep until we reached the top of a street with many small shops and places to eat. Very crowded with jeeps and people along the road ... The scenery is beautiful at dawn (it is also a bit cold ... better bring a jacket, gloves and hat). We took the jeep again (better take a photo of the plate .. they are all the same and it is easy to confuse them) ... then when we arrive near the volcano we start a long walk to get to the top ... all beautiful ... breathtaking landscape"
"A very memorable trip. If you are looking for a sunrise spot that is no less amazing, try visiting Bromo."
"It was definitely a fun hike, my parents could do it regardless their age and physical condition. Also, the great view and fresh air really helped me to relax."
"Clearly the best memory that i have from Java Indonesia. This is an unique place and shouldn't think twice about going there, it's totally worth it. The place is huge, there is many things to explore around so be sure to come at least the whole day. Take a jacket as well, cause it's quite cold in the morning."
It was an amazing adventure. We did that all with our 2 year old daughter. She slept in the car most of the time and was amazed and happy to see all these wonder of nature.
Highlight of our holidays!
One of the most beautiful places I have visited. Our itinerary started early in the morning with us driving to the top of a mountain near Bromo and we witnessed one of the best sunrises from the view.
Amazing experience of this volcano
Great place to visit and climb. Sunrise and sunset view are really great. The sea of sands is also amazing.
The most beautiful sunrise I've ever seen. Try to arrive at 3 or 4 am to find the beautiful viewing spot.
Amazing views to see sunrise and a great experience walking to the crater rim. Seeing the mist rising from the valley with volcanoes behind is a sight to behold.
Most Beautiful view in the world. Thousands of colourful jips crawling up the mountain is also a rare and beautiful sight. The temperature is very cold and pleasant.
The picturesque view took my breath away when we saw the sunrise and the volcano.It was also a great experience going up the stairs to look at the crater .Smoke were still coming out from the crater as it was an active volcano.It was a once in a life time opportunity to see the volcano and it was a very enjoyable visit.

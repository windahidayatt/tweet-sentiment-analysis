Terrifying experience
Disappointing - cannot see the temples and monkeys aggressive
It's a really dangerous place. DONT BRING CHILDREN.
"The monkeys have rabies. Yes the forest is pretty, but it’s not worth the risk. Personally I nearly got bitten and was terrified enough."
Nothing special. Monkeys are very aggressive - I was sitting on a bench and they peed on me from above. Be careful about sitting under trees.
This is my 4th time to monkey forest and this one is a very disappointing.
Avoid. Agresive monkeys. I needed 3 switches and 3 shots in local hospital
"This is a walk of harassment with monkeys literally jumping all over you, grabbing your things to try and get food. A bit disappointing"
Within 5 mins of being here I was attacked by a monkey and bitten - spent the entire day in hospital getting jabs and medicines. Really would not recommend
Dangerously careless management. Elsewhere this place would be already shut down.
"I never thought I would love my walk around this place. They have preserved it very well. Monkeys are cute but naughty as well, very playful. Staffs around are very helpful with photos and directions. Oh, and there is a small gallery with collection of art works of various artists for the art lovers."
amazing place and cute little monkeys are everywhere! Love it!
very cute. my favorite spot in Ubud. the sanctuary is very big and a lot of monkeys inside. but don't touch the monkey.
We loved our visit to the monkey forest in Ubud. We drove on our moped and there was plenty of parking available outside the forest. Tickets were cheap and getting there was super simple. Be prepared to get waved down by people trying to get you to visit the nearby coffee plantation on your way.
"Awesome, really awesome"
"I really loved monkeys those were really fun to see. Actually they caught my sunglass but i had another one. Be prepared not to loose your stuffs. Very calm forest with full of wild animals. I took selfie with bats and giant snake. Totally, I would recommend. Great place with good service"
We really enjoyed the Monkey Forest!!
Loved this place. Really beautiful grounds and a lot of little rascals. It's also convenient to walk from the south to the north of the monkey forest to get to the other side of town. As long as you don't mess with the monkeys they won't mess with you. Really loved this place.
Absolutely fantastic place monkeys everywhere you looked & so tame loved seeing them in natural surroundings & so well cared for had great fun when one of the monkeys was having a look in my bag you have to keep hold of your sunglasses etc as they will steal anything the setting is beautiful it was very hot day we visited so didn’t stay as long as I would of liked due to the heat I will definitely visit again next time in Bali kids would love it & only costs a few pounds for entry
Monkey tried to grab my sunglasses. It was awesome. You could sit next to them and the more friendly of them would be totally cool with that.

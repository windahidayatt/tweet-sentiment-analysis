"I'm a world traveler, worst tour I've ever taken. I'd like a refund!!!"
Patronising and disappointing
Horrible experience today trying to get to the 245pm kids vivaldi 4 seasons. Herded into cloak area and held there in a claustrophibic crowd for 25 minutes and not allowed up the stairs until 10 mins before the show.
"Terrible, should've been better!"
Terrible experience with kid
Been queuing for an hour to pickup pre-paid tickets. This is the most inefficient system I have ever experienced. Any concert hall worth their salt would have self service ticket machines. What a waste of time
Very disappointed
Terrible they actually charge money for this!
So disappointed!
Extremely Unsatisfying
"Wow, what a great building. Interesting how it was built. The photos of the construction project are amazing!! We could not get tickets to a show. But we did go back in the evening for the light and slide show projected on the sails of the opera house. Very very cool!!"
Not too bad if you haven't been before.Great view to the inside and different areas of the opera house and some history of the building. Magnificent structure
"Just a sight seeing trip, was really enjoyable to see a great feet of engineering ! Especially with the harbour bridge so close ! Area close is expensive but good to see !"
"No matter how many times I have seen it, it wows me every time. No matter how many photos I have taken of it, I always want to take more. Its magic lasts forever."
"The most iconic building in Sydney is a feast for the eyes with an interesting history. It juts out into the harbor and at times it appears larger than I expected and then surprisingly smaller than I expected, depending upon the angle."
"This is one of the most famous building in the world. Beautiful architecture especially at night. Its beautiful whether you see it from the ferry, from Sydney bridge or close up. A must see Iconic building when in Sydney."
"I honestly don't know if this was the specific tour we did or not, but it was a guided tour of the opera house. I really enjoyed seeing this iconic location! The tour guide made a few accommodations to avoid steps for our older group of visitors, which was very much appreciated."
"Spectacular architecture, we bought a ticket to visit inside the Opera House, it was a guided tour with details of the history of the building."
The entire opera house complex is truly spectacular and well worth a visit. There are a number of tours. We did the breakfast tour which was disappointing but overall the whole water front area and the opera house is a place you should visit.
A great Visit

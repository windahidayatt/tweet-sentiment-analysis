Too crowdy and fireworks were firing all over the place. A dangerous place to be there on that night.
Not recommanded for New Year... You can not have the clear view to take a photo. Fot the new year eve there was the gate 200m till the Brandenburger Tor. The view of the fireworks from the main street was blocked by the side buildings!!! Sooo disappointed!!!!!!
"I am very disappointed, because we could not see the monument. It was all blocked by the police, because of the visit of the Turkish president! It is a tourist site and the VIP guest was not even close to it, but the access was still restricted?! Very poor organization!!"
Such a disappointment
Just a boring tourist attraction. Very crowded. Too overrated. Be careful of moochers. Nothing to do there. You cant even take good picture because of all that people.
"So, You must have seen pictures of this place, right? You must have been impressed, right? Well, stick with the thought, because once there you discover that there's nothing impressive about it. It's a gate. And a very small one. That's all there is to it. Very disappionting."
Because of the World Cup they had the gate totally cut off for a function in the area. Couldn't get a decent photo. I was so disappointed to come all this way not to see the whole area.
"Crowded, hectic, noisy, overrated fake-looking hotspot, hated, stay away from it. The guy in costume playing music should be arrested for spoiling Berlin's tourism industry."
I imagine it is stunning when it is not covered in scaffolding but unfortunately it was being set up for a concert and we could not really get a good impression of it.
Had a wonderful wintry visit to this monument. It was beautiful however undergoing renovations so not accessible to the public. Disappointing .
An absolute must visit. If there is time only for one thing then this should be the one to see. Very easy to reach to from our hotel.
"Monument to the German capital and people, a must see if visiting the city. Great architecture and close to the Unter den Linden and Reichstag. There are also good nearby train stations and u bahn links. Recommended."
We visited Berlin with the attention of seeing some historical monuments and soaking up the local history. We were not disappointed and look forward to returning.
An unforgettable experience and a must visit.At night takes on a totally different perspective.So much history
"Fantastic display, come rain or shine"
A monumental place to see if you visit Berlin. Park nearby is attractive. Close to Germany Parliament buildings.
Great atmosphere at the Brandenburger Tor. Massive crowd of youngsters dancing and drinking at night in a relaxed vibe.
walked here after visiting the largest dept store. I think it would look even better lit up/. Lots of tour guides available at very reasonable cost
"Iconic monument of Berlin, definitely a must-go-to monument when visiting Berlin. Quite a lot a people though, so better going early morning or late evening"
"No visit to Berlin would be complete without a trip to see the Brandenburg Gate. This historic monument has become a truly iconic symbol and it certainly does not disappoint. If you visit in the evening, the gate is lit up which makes for some great photo opportunities!"

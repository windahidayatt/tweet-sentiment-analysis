the show is disappointing
A waste of time and way too many aggressive monkeys around
Warning: dangerous for children
The Temple is off course very beautiful But I really couldn’t stand the busses with the very rude Chinese tourists . They have no manners And getting run over by the selfie sticks
"It has no historical significance. Its hot, sticky with lots of people crammed into an open air arena. Then the main event starts which is just annoying."
However I want to warn of the imposed tours that we were unfortunate enough to experience.
"Extremely boring! Temple is closed, so nothing to see, except for some really nice views from cliffs"
Horrible experience - Temple and Fire Dance
Staff behaviour was disgusting!
Disappointed visit
Uluwatu is one of the must visit place/temple in Bali. Cliff view is awesome. Nice view around the temple. Best attraction is Kecak & Fire Dance show which tells about Ramayanam and i say don't miss it. Show happens during 5PM and ends upon Sunset.
Amazing Uluwatu
must seeing places at Uluwatu! Big and beautiful! very instagramable!
Once in a lifetime experience. The beautiful temple with an amazing sunset really took my breath away. Amazing amazing experience
"Beautiful historic temple, amazing sunset alongside the mesmerising Kecak Fire dance"
Absolutely breathtaking! We took our children here and we all had a great time. $5 entry and $15 for the Kecap dance which is reasonable and well worth it. Lovely views and all round great Indonesian experience
One of the best place in bali
"Beautiful views and sunset. we bought tickets to the Kecak Fire Dance as well. The dance is slow starting but once it does get going it's most entertaining, this show is in demand and we were advised to get our tickets before 5pm . We did we sat opposite the sea and got beautiful shots of the sunset as well."
"The overall feelings on this place is great, the ambience of the place also great. the sunset with Kecak dance was the highlight of my trip here, it was so amazing! Recommended"
"Very beautiful and scenic view! You will fall in love in this place no matter how many times you go here. You can either choose to enjoy the sunset by Uluwatu Temple, or enjoy the sunset by watching their Kecak dance. Both is an unique experience by itself."

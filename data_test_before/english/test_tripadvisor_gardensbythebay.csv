It was just amazingly huge and amazingly good . The flower dome blew my mind with its range of plant life from all over the world. And then the cloud dine with its feature waterfall and skywsll was mesmerising- espas the sun went down
"I had gone to this beautiful and wonderful Garden along with my family and friends, it is worth visiting while you are in Singapura. The more you wonder in this garden, you still pause that no corner escapes your eyes. You end up there the whole day, still you long for more."
There are so many amazing displays of flowers that its hard to pick a favorite. But the Orchid section was awesome.
"Big spacious garden, beautiful scenery n peaceful. There are many attractions (need to pay for entrance) within the garden."
We visited Gardens by the Bay in March and were not disappointed its such a wonderful place the gardens and plants are stunning
Comfortable and exhilarating
You should definitely visit Gardens by the Bay while you are there! The garden and the lights and the trees are amazing!
Beautiful park with some high viewpoints from where you can look out all over the park and parts of the city. This park is a must if you are visiting Singapore.
Gardens by the Bay is not to be missed when visiting Singapore. Everything in that park is magnificent. My favorite part is the evening lights show.
"This was the best part of visiting Singapore! Gardens are apsolutely stunning and amazing! We decided to go before sunset and enjoy, and after stayed for night light show. Maybe it was over crowded during the night, but worth it!"
I guess it’s great to do with kids or something but it’s not really anything interesting for adults.
Awful in the rain! Christmas Wonderland it wasn’t.
Disappointed with the information desk
totally dissappointing. no indication of where the entrance starts. not driving friendly routes. after we parked the car no indication on where we should proceed to the main gallery. the place is nice but $32 is totally high priced. please be more realistic in pricing. its just christmas songs and the shows were absurd.
"Awful experience! Too many people. Crowds and queues were hectic. I would have paid to get out of there fast! We went after lunch, very hot. Probably better to go at night when not as hot. Avoid peak hours if you can. Go to a real rainforest!"
"Frighteningly distasteful display of full-blown political misinfmation. I told my family to “look away” lest they be turned to stone. Please. Let us enjoy the biological diversity without the brainwashing. Thank you, very much!"
Poor quality
Nothing interesting at all. Expensive to enter. And all things inside is very expensive. Including food and drinks. Dont bother even if you have spare time.
Unhelpful Assistance from the Security Officer
Mostly Disappointing

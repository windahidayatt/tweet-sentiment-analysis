Visited as part of a 5 day tour. Our guide provided many of the stories that related to the areas we visited. Good to see the closure of the climbing of the rock and allow tourists to visit and explore and support the traditional owners of the land.
"Uluru is fascinating as well as beautiful and stunning beyond compare. The impressive rock formation jutting up in the middle of nearly flat land for hundreds of miles around is a sight that has to be seen to be appreciated and should not be missed! Appearing differently in all lights and times of day, it's fascinating to see anytime - and we were impressed at sunrise and sunset and also at all other times of the day. We couln't get enough of Uluru and just kept taking more pictures from every different angle in the ever-changing light. Don't miss Uluru!"
"I can’t believe it took me so long to visit this wonderous, nurturing and spiritual place! I highly recommend visiting and doing the two hour walk around the base. Make sure you pack a fly net though - they are out in force."
"Saw close up and at a distance, sunset and sunrise. Changes in colours and atmospehre at different times of day is wonderful."
What can you say about this amazing breathtaking location. Without doubt one of the most mind blowing spots on earth. We walked around the base and the kids minds were blown hahah
The sunset viewing point is wonderful. At the moment there is no competition for great spots. Sunrise is worth seeing too. It is not as big but it is very special.
"Wow, wow, wow is all I can say! An absolutely spectacular place to visit & a must do! So much to see from caves, paintings & beautiful scenery with stories of the people who lived there along the way. To see Uluru, words cannot describe & photos do no justice at all. The short walks are easy & well worth it. The 10.6km walk took 3 hours, easy to do as no rocks & a great walking track but very long. You definitely see a lot more. A fly net is advised & Good walking shoes!"
"Loved, loved, loved the outback and Uluru. Went to both the sunrise and sunset tours to watch the colors of Uluru change. Beautiful. Definitely took tons of photos"
"A fantastic base walk tour. Learning about the history, background and beliefs was fascinating. Our tour guide (Ryan) was very knowledgable and passionate about the tour and narrated the stories with energy. We loved every minute. Thank you."
"With only a small number of tourist, present, it was fantastic to take in the whole environment around Uluru."
Hours of flying to see a rock THAT YOU CANT EVEN CLIMB! Don’t bother. It’s just not worth it.
don't bother and take a flynet please at total waste of time just a big stone sticking up in the desert
"Yet, the biggest problem was the need to wake and eat on someone else's schedule. Getting up before 6:00 in the morning on a vacation is ridiculous. Yet, travel and tour plans dictated such a schedule. We were told to be ready 15 minutes early, and we were. Then the drivers were late, creating stress and resentment. "
Disappointing waste of time. Expensive to get in and you can only go for a 3 day pass. They close the the walk up over nothing.
"Go somewhere else and experience Australia without fences, thousands of tourists and without getting ripped of by expensive entry fees, food, accommodation etc"
Disappointed in trip to Ayers Rock
Don’t bother! Just not worth it!!
don't bother and take a flynet please at total waste of time just a big stone sticking up in the desert
"The hardest part is that the park rangers won't lift a finger to help you plan. If you ask them if the trails will be open the next day, they tell you ""maybe"" and ""you shouldn't use them anyway."" Then you drive 20mins out to Uluru, pay to enter the park, just to find them closed again. Frustrating."
"It was a bit cloudy, no rain anywhere, and they closed the climb to the top. So ridiculous. Unless you can climb up, it's a waste of time."

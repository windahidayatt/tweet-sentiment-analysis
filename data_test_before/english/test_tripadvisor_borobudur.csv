"Sunrise in Borobudur temple. Mystical place full of history, beautiful but always crowded both at sunrise and sunset. If you are in Indonesia it is a must .. to visit without doubts"
"This temple is enormous! There's a garden around the temple. Surf around and you will eventually reach the temple. At the temple, the views were amazing no matter from the bottom or the top of the temple. There carvings are so incredible that it has got its own meaning along the beginning to the end of the temple. Do hire a guide to tell you more about the story of the carving! Worth the visit!"
"Stay nearby, and go in the morning or evening to avoid the heat. Prices are fair. But get a guide to show you the reliefs and explain all the intricacies you would miss if you weren't an expert on the site and history."
"Impressive temple complex that was hidden, very nice to visit and walk around at the complex in peace and respect"
"Beautiful temple with a deep historical stories. The surrounding area of the site is well maintained, however level 9 & 10 of the temple is temporarily closed due to conservation & preservation projects, therefore we were not able to explore more to the top level. Overall, it is a nice place you should visit"
It is a amazing sunrise place. It is a world biggest Buddhist temple from AD 9. Build with Javanese and Buddhist culture.
We did a day excursion from Semarang as we were on a cruise. The central Java landscape was captivating on the 2 and a half hour drive to the temple. The temple is fascinating with intricate carvings from Buddhism in the walls. The surrounding gardens are well maintained.
Stunning. Go for sunrise to avoid the crowds. Peaceful location. Go explore away from the mass of people and see the amazing carvings. Much smaller site than Angkor Wat (if you’ve been there before).
"We got a guide, who was over 70 and his insight and passion for the temple was amazing, he was so friendly it really added an extra dimension to the trip to see this amazing wonder."
Seeing the chained up elephants at the end of the trip ruined the entire day. We would not have entered the park had we known these elephants would be there. Why are these elephants needed at the park? Do the right thing and hand them over to animal rescue. How can you teach Buddhism and treat these animals like this? You should be ashamed.
"Came with my Indonesian relatives. Ticket prices are ridiculous high for foreigners. Locals paid only IDR 40,000 whereby for foreigners the price is 10 times higher. It is ridiculous. Nothing much to view. Just a large garden with not much landscaping and an Unesco Temple building. Not worth the price of the ticket. Don't waste your money here."
Horrible horrible horrible - no need for elephants to be here full stop let alone be chained and held as tourist attraction! do not visit it is not worth adding to the tourism money here when it's being used in such a cruel way.
Horrific treatment of animals! Including elephants!
A Horror trip!
Horrible Elephant house ruined the whole trip
"While the temple is a nice attraction, if not extremely overpriced, seeing the 'elephant park' ruined the entire experience. Three distressed elephants were chained up in a tiny barn while one was chained in a more open, yet still small, area so tourists could feed it."
"Don't go there! You support animal cruelty! After the temple they offer elephant riding with big baskets, which hurts the elephant. The guides were smoking on the animals!!! 2 other elephants were chained with a just 2meter-long steel-chain and had to stand on stone floor without water or food!"
"The price is abusive, ridiculous, considering that Angkor Wat, the mother of all temples cost 40usd for 3days, completely worth it. Note that the locals pay 13 times less this price, so i note that there is a kind of mafia with the travel agencies, in order they bought ticket for locals for you. So, like almost everything in Java, if you want to go by yourself they will do as difficult and/or disgusting as possible."
"This site has almost nothing to offer except for hordes of tourists, endless queues and souvenir/junk shops."
"Boring, pointless, and riddled with peddlers."

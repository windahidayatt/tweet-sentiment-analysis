"bad experience,rude workers"
Such a bad experience. Very disappointed. Temple was nice but the people make it worst.
A holy site that's turned into a money grabbing tourist attraction. Crowded and dirty. Vendors begging and selling cheap trinkets everywhere.
Don't agree with paying the $8 to go in to a religious site. As you enter up the stairs you get people begging you to buy all sorts of rubbish trinkets. It was crowded and felt like a tourist trap rather than a religious site.
Overated pagoda visit if you have seen better ones else where in the country.
"The pagoda is very dirty. While yes, it looks nice at night time. But you have to walk barefooted and your feet will go all black from the dirt. There are cockroaches and rats crawling around the place too. Really disappointing. I was rushing myself to leave the place and go take a shower! I suggest avoidin the back parts and stick to the main walkway because the rats and cockroaches avoid those areas because ofthe foot traffic."
Discrimination!!!
I hate paying to visit religious shrines and when i paid my $8US i immediately regretted it. It's a place so sacred that you can't wear shoes but they allow the telcos to advertise 'free wifi'. I say take a pass on the big P and instead go to one of the overlooking restaurants and enjoy the view from above.
"Terribly disappointed to find out that the main Pagoda is under scaffolding, the main reason for my visit to Yangon. "
"Building is beautiful but not user friendly for foreigners ... Can't wear shoes or socks, the ground is very hot, really bad that there's no water for washing hands at the exits , so dirty."
This is THE attraction of Yangon. Defiantly worth the visit. I recommend a privait guide if you want to understand the site.
"One of the world wonders for sure, this Pagoda shows only beauty. a Beautiful building full of spiritual atmosphere"
"Absolutely beautiful, stunning! Our guide was wise in taking us in the late evening when it was cooler and the suns setting rays glinted on the gorgeous Pagoda"
"It is a very nice place in the evening, and the atmosphere is great. A lot of people sit around and enjoy the view"
"This gorgeous pagoda is breathtaking in its attention to detail and overall breathtaking beauty. It's a majestic and sacred monument to Buddhism and embodies the glory with which people in Myanmar honor the Buddha. There's so much to see, particularly as encompassing the various tenets of Buddhism, that it takes time to grasp everything we're seeing. There are areas representing various parts of the (I think Chinese) zodiac, where people lay flowers and candles. Come in and pay respects to the temple and what it represents."
Fantastic and beautiful pagoda
Really unbelievable the craftmanship and worksmanship shown here. This all meant something so important to some peoples
"Definitely worth a visit, a vast gold leaf covered 99 metre pagoda. Very impressive indeed. As with everywhere in Myanmar you have to take shoes and socks off which can be something of a challenge in the heat of the day. It keeps you moving and still well worth the effort!"
Incredible. Just incredible.
"Highly recommended by many friends. It is a requirement that all shoes and socks need to be removed when entering this Pagoda, my guide arranged for us to visit in the late evening when the floors are much cooler. Impressed with the dedications of the Myanmar devotees that such a magnificent structures were constructed. Worth a visit if you go Yangon."

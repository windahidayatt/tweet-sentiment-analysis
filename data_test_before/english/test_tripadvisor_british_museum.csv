Visited the Tantra exhibition. I felt extremely uncomfortable. Far too many people were let in. We left within 10 minutes
"Pretty poor really when most other attractions, historical and otherwise, have done their best to to manage Curonavirus and reopen ASAP .. this place is not re-opening until the end of August, like after the summer Hols when the kids are about to go back to school. I bet if it was a private company running Museums they would have found a safe way to open by now, after all, they have had a five month holiday .. disgraceful"
Been trying to book tickets for troy exhibition all week and impossible to book through website as it doesnt load properly on android. Now saying sold out. Useless
A disappointing Afternoon Tea experience
The place is suffocated with people. Poor signposting for exhibitions. Catering poor. Troy poorly curated. Waste of time
When viewing the Elgin marbles I felt a great disappointment in the British museum. It struck me they have basically received stolen goods and are refusing to return them! I expected more integrity from what should be an institution above reproach! Not impressed... I almost felt like organising a boycott. I'm sorry I went there!
Terrible behaviour of security staff
Way too crowded in the summer. Not enough variety..... most.y ancient artifacts- not my cup of tea. They charge for certain exhibits which is so wrong! Sorry I wasted my time
Unfriendly and unhelpful staff
Terrible experience wouldn't let us in
"One of the best museum I ever seen before : lots of masterpieces, a very nice building and a very nice organisation inside. You cannot don't go there if you travel in London. Only a fool can avoided the British Museum. If you like history please don't miss the Rosetta Stone. It's a big pebble with some writing in different languages. Definitely a masterpiece too. Have fun !"
One word. Massive! Very organized and clean. There was oh so much to see and I fell more in love with the artifacts and the history behind this massive building. Would love to go again especially for the museum.
"I absolutely love going to the British Museum! The entrance is free and there is so much to see! I always stay for over an hour, to explore and discover new things, that I might have missed during my last visit "
"Always a pleasure to visit this museum, having been to a lot of them over the years both abroad and in the UK this is still my favourite."
Enjoyable return to a favourite museum.
"It's do popular to the world it makes me proud to be a British citizen . The loveliest part of London to. I’m a massive fan of Egyptology so it was perfect . The staff, security and workers on the cafe and shops are so friendly . Not easy during Covid 19. Well organised"
One of the best museums in the world
Wonderful museum with so much to see and so much treasure to behold. My favourite area is the mummys. So glad the museum is open again.
The British museum houses an extraordinary collection of fascinating artefacts from all over the world. The Egyptian section is fantastic for kids (and adults) there is so much to see. It is beautifully curated and well worth the visit. I could spend days in there.
Needless to say this is a must visit attraction for anyone coming to London and the India section has some lovely pieces.

After yelling at them for for 45 minutes....they finally managed to come up with spare key to let us out. A totally unpleasant experience.
"The experience itself was bad. Few locals just cut the queue, which was very upsetting and frustrated."
"Boring place, nothing to do, as a white woman feels like everyone is watching at you. Full of local tourist groups. Very dirty after tourist groups leave"
"This monument was intended as a monument for national identity for all Indonesian, where everybody can walk enjoy the park like the Central park. Since last Nov this park has been the place for stinky political activity. So avoid this place for now."
The most inaccessible monument in the world
The monument in the middle has no interest unless flattering some important person's ego. Guess who…
"Worse place to visit in Jakarta. Long long walks. Poor signage. Absolutely handicap unfriendly. Too many steps, no elevators, rude employees, no English speaking employees, very hot inside and no place to sit n relax. I had a knee replacement and walking with an ankle brace and I would pay anyone whatever amount to find me a wheelchair. They just don't care. So if you have trouble walking and can't climb stairs avoid this place. It's horrifying."
Left Out of Frustration
"Terrible place, absolutely tourist unfriendly"
This location is surely not for foringers. This is a locals hangout. I had a very bad experience here. 
Good place from the top you can see all the jakarta city i visit for the first time today i enjoy very well
We went here with our guide from Holiday Jakarta Tour. It's wonderful to get to know the history and meaning of this monument for Indonesian.
A must-see monument to visit in Jakarta. Set in lovely gardens. Westerners need to dress with decorum.
"I enjoyed my visit this great monument of Indonesia , this place is really must visit place of Indonesia"
Beautiful clean and breeze has made my visit to this place was perfect. Adore the flame on the top that plated by 35 kg of gold.
Monas Statue Square Monument and the area has a large yard and a beautiful garden near the train station Gambir and a number of popular markets and malls
"A popular monument. A must visit when travelling or stop by at Jakarta. For me, night time view are better to photograph MONAS."
"Very nice monument we could see this from a long distance when we were in the city my group of 40 people all wanted to go near to it,when we went there all appreciated."
"Mona's is the best place to be! Great food, the place is cool to relax...take some nice pictures with my friends and the Indonesian people are very kind! "
Beautiful Monument to Independence

"I paid 80.00 USD for my photo package, and the code does not work. Complete rip off. I emailed twice and called the call center, which directed me to email. Still no response. I also reached out on Twitter. They directed me to the email again. Nothing. I'M UPSET. I don't have access to any of the memories created here."
Horrible Service during COVID-19 Pandemic
Was not picked up until 2:30pm by the company's shuttle bus. After an hour drive we were not told by the company when booking the excursion that most of the extra activities closed at 4:30-5:00. We were also not told that all of the extras including the snorkel gear would cost extra money. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!
Wouldn’t recommend it! Not worth it
My advise save your money it's not worth it at all. Very disappointed!.
Horrible customer service
Most depressing place in Playa del Carmen
I was told they give you free sunscreen to protect the animals when you enter. This isn't true. Only if you bring your own sunscreen will they give it to you for free. I paid so much to enter and then they charge you for this. Really annoying.
Didn't bother staying for the grand show as we were so disappointed with the rest of the park. Couldn't wait to get out of there.
Truly no words can express the disappointment Xcaret made my family and I go through. We had our first family trip in over 10+ years in Cancun where the only exception we made to invest outside of our hotel resort was to go to Xcaret. 
What a great place to see to many things! COVID preparedness was great too. Food at the paying restaurant was wonderful! Highly recommend
Perfect! Everyday had so much fun!! Would return..staff is friendly and attentive.. beach area is clean as is the whole place! Fun for kids and teenagers!
"We had an awesome time in Xcaret this past week. Felt safe at all times with the new guidelines in place. The staff is super friendly, it seem as if they were trained by Disney."
Best experience ever
"This park was absolutely beautiful . From the moment you walk in you are transformed to a world rich with culture, nature and Mayan/Aztec history. There is much to see and do from the rivers, open ocean, and inlets. Park is very clean, sanitized for Covid protocols and safe. Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable . There is a variety of snack bars and restaurants , restrooms are clean, lockers/showers and changing areas available."
"This park is truly amazing! Be sure to do the underground rivers!! Swim with the dolphins!! It is an all day park so be prepared to do some walking. So many swim places and things to see. Be sure to go to the night show under the big pavilion, so worth seeing! Plan to get wet and have some fun!"
"This is one of my favorite parks from Cancun love it that I have visit 5 times already in the past 3 years, and the show in the afternoon is amazing this is a must go to if you are planning of going to a park in xcaret this is one of the most complete popular park of all, just that the food is not that good and the beach is beautiful"
XCARET! Was nice we loved the last show we purchased the dinner for the last show is optional but is better because they give you a better place for the show
The park is absolutely beautiful. It is such an incredible experience if you want to experience a lot of different Mayan and Mexican culture. The wildlife and scenery were just spectacular. I really enjoyed the river swims that take you through the entire park. The water is crystal clear and very refreshing in that humid heat. The food also at the buffet was very good. 
Such an amazing park with lots to do and see. Excellent cenotes and food and shows. If you buy your tickets 15 days in advance online you can save 15% on the tickets too! Truly an amazing place for the whole family.

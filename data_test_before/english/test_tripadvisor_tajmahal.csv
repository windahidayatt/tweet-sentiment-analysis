"We were a group of 13 visiting on the 4th of March. We entered at 15h. When leaving at 18h, on the 3h time frame we were told at the same gate that we had exceed the 3h time frame and forced to pay extra 600 INR to exit. No receipt. No intervention from the Police. Shame on you Agra. When corruption gets to the symbol of a nation something must be very wrong."
"The Indian government are extorting from tourists by charging a ridiculous amount from entrance fees! also lots of harassment from guides and photographers, one guide even lied and told us his service was free with the entrance fee, which is a big con as he would’ve then demanded a huge tip at the end."
People want to visit this place for culture happiness and also it is so what called Wonder of he world but recently I have noticed there are paan and other rubbish spotted the whiteness is like a hello red gutka freak you
I dont Understand how this became world wonder .Still we have Ajantha and ellora archeologyical mystery ..
"The streets outside were dangerous and full of shopkeepers trying to use every trick in the book to get you inside their shops, Tuktuks stopping every few seconds and no pavements. The area smelt of urine and the money earned from the tourist dollar most definately isn't being invested back into the infrastructure."
"My first negative review and sadly it had to be for this world famous ""wonder of the world"". What a terrible letdown this was. The review is not for the monument itself. The architecture of the Taj is absolutely breathtaking but everything else around is just so very horrible."
Very Bad Experience
Its not as it say because one had to walk a long very long to reach Taj Mahal & the attitude of the Staff is very rude even the Police Personnel. Everytime I visit their is always the Renovation going on & once visit is must.
Nowadays it seems more like a tourist trap than a must see monument. Touts from all ages will make your way to the entrance a nightmare.
It's really annoying with all the guys that tries to scam you every 10th meter or so. Nice building but I'm not that impressed.
Taj Mahal is beautiful if you select the correct time which is early morning or late evening but check the entry timings which are till 5 PM only. It's not just the Taj Mahal but the massive gardens and the entry gates and the Yamuna river at back that enhance it's beauty and what more can I say where billions might have visited before me..... Highly recommend but go at right time and in the right weather which is winters.
Best place I've ever visited in my life agra is the city of heritage and one of the place with a wonder of the World.
Its Uniquely made.Took 20 years for this masterpiece.Wonder how they did this.Great architect considering bult anciently
"Such a beautiful place,. what an incredible architecture. No words to explain the beauty of this place. Must visit monument in India."
"It was a wonderful experience, especially if you go early in the morning, when the crowd is not there yet. A guide is indispensable, I think, to get the most of it."
Beauty of world. Superb place. Just relax in garden & view it. It's a diamond of India. Don't miss it. Beautiful carving
"Taj Mahal is an amazing master piece,archectural bueauful monument,,,indentification of India,,,a must visit in India"
"What's there to say. It's the Taj Mahal, one of the most well-known buildings in the world. The whole complex is beautiful. Crowded, yes, even if you go there at opening time. There's no escaping the crowds, but it's still worth it. Morning is the best time to go. Watch the colours change as the sun comes up. It's absolutley stunning."
The minarets and other features such as the dome and the beautiful pool is absolutely spectacular. I adore this building.
Its truly one of the world wonders. The site has a lot of history and culture and you can't just leave without immersing your self into this gigantic landscape.

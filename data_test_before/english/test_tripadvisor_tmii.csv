Very sad to visit with kids. The destruction is allover the country. many soyaplantage. Not visit again.
"Awful, tacky, boring"
The park is extremely old and rundown. We walked on the road as the sidewalk was so bad.
Very disappointing
"All dirty, smell and old fashion.Furthermore it is far from Jakarta. The ticket is also expensive even for tourists like us"
"The park is not well maintained, has no easy-to-find maps for handout, only occasional signs and explanations in English and a difficult to find information center. "
This place was horrible.
One of the worst tourist attractions i have ever been too. The model of each of the houses from Indonesian provinces were not worth visiting at all.
Very very poorly maintained.
"This is the most dirtiest family park I have ever been. Messed up and just too over crowded by hawkers. Stay away, people and the employee are nothing friendly but perhaps this was actually more Jakarta than Indonesia"
Top Attraction in Jakarta
I love this place very much. Fairly enough to visit and to understand Indonesia culture within hours. Everything is centralised in here. Worth to visit. Instagram worthy! Nice shoot with the temple and miniatures.
It was a very good experience visiting the park. I was with a group of 38 person all from Bangladesh they all expressed it is wonderful.
Beautiful Indonesia mini park the best recommendation for Jakarta City Tour
I went here with my friends and booked tour with holiday jakarta city tour. This is incredible park with excellent education about culture and tradition of Indonesia. Recommended for tourists seeking for activity.
"The place is sooo huge, you dont have to enter with Grab because there are extra fees for transportation to go in. And you can rent a scooter for 50,000rupees for 1 hour. Theres so many spot for you to take pics, the environment is safe and organised. Helpful and friendly staff. Highly recommended"
Very interesting museum to have an impression of multinational Indonesia
I had the pleasure to walk and marvel at the rich culture of Indonesia inside this beautiful park. 
"Its very good for the history lover, love to go that place...lots of good things to learn and can share with your friends and family"
"Lovely place to pass away a couple of hours, staff very friendly and an interesting history of culture. Within a short walk there are plenty of places for a light snack."

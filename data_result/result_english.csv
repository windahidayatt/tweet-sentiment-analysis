Disappointing,-1
Unfortunately this place is not kept well. What a pity that such a historical site is neglected. The only thing that was of any value were the various examples of royal era dressing.,-1
Very sad palace.,-1
"As many said, it was a sad, horrible place to be.",-1
"It was so bad that is was so sad. There’s nothing to see except for a few old buildings. Indoor is very stuffy. Old pots, ceremonial stuff, and shirts. Do yourself a favour and give it a miss. It was so bad that I didn’t take any photos.",-1
"Another disappointment visit. I was expecting to see a lavish and royal Palace fit for a King, but it was sad and empty.",-1
Bad lighting & stuffy rooms did not help its case. It was a total waste of time.,-1
Worst museum ever!,-1
This place of attraction was not in good conditions. Dirty and no proper maintenance. Boring place to visit.,-1
This palace was horrible. From the point you enter and see the garden you can tell this place is not well maintained. ,-1
Experienced the history of jogja. The guide given the important information about the kings and the palace.,1
"The place is comfortably supported by excellent service that makes us feel at home or linger here, one more view of this place I feel the best, I suggest that excellent service can be maintained or even improved. I hope the people here will always be successful. Let's pray for each other for the good and benefit together, best regard, see u next time",1
Visiting this palace with my friend and this is one of our highlights to add on more knowledge and learning the social culture of java and of course enjoying few more activities inside this palace.. keep it up!,1
Great place to visit if you want to learn the history of Jogykarta. Very educational. Lots of local people visit here and only 10000 for entry.,1
"One of the best memories of the past glory, history, culture and archetecture of the people living in that beautiful land. Not to miss.",1
"Well worth the visit to see how the Yogyakarta royal family lived, or even lives, today. The palace is small so easy to do in a morning, but make sure you visit the less well known leisure palace which is quite beautiful, a very short drive from the palace. Informative guide.",1
Nice place to visit. The guided tour was very good. Schedule about hour to hour and half. Lots of artifacts. Recommended!,1
